# automate-sorting-algorithms
This is a Java program to automate testing of sorting algorithms

This sorting algorithm, like all sorting algorithms, is given an input array and sorts it out to be in ascending order. I started working on this by creating many sketches of every step of the way that the algorithm performs, and writing some pseudo code. Here is a small rundown of the algorithm (recommended to look at the code while you are reading this): I start by finding a pivot which I assumed to be the middle element in the array I am looking at. Then, I find the boundary of all the elements in the array that are smaller than the pivot, in order to do that, everytime in the loop that I find an element that is smaller than the pivot I use a recursive method which loops through the array in between that element I am looking at and the end of the array, the point of that method is to find and replace a smaller element in the array with that element we started with, then when we get the boundary, run the main sorting algorithm again recursively on the smaller than pivot array and the bigger. That project was very hard to complete as coding something that has never been done before, and I had no reference or someway to check If I was correct, therefore, my debugging skills came in very hendy as I spent about 95% of the time working on this project just debugging and trying to figure out how am I supposed to solve this, also figuring out why this code was not working and then trying to come up with a solution that doesnâ€™t disrupt the process of that I wanted. But eventually it worked and I got an algorithm that performs in between nln(n) and n^2.
